# TV-scripts-generation

In this project, I have generated my own Seinfeld TV scripts using RNNs. A part of the Seinfeld dataset of scripts from 9 seasons has been used. The Neural Network built here generate a new ,"fake" TV script, based on patterns it recognizes in this training data.


This is one of the projects that I have completed under the [Udacity Deep Learning Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/deep-learning-nanodegree--nd101) Program.
